# Smart-Traffic-Light
Smart Traffic Light Control System with Pedestrian Safety Feature
Overview
This project implements a Smart Traffic Light Control System using Arduino, designed to optimize traffic flow at an intersection. The system detects traffic on both main and side roads using sensors and adapts the signal timing accordingly. It also features a pedestrian safety mechanism that activates a buzzer when pedestrians are detected while a green light is on, ensuring pedestrian awareness.

Features
Adaptive Traffic Lights: Automatically adjusts the traffic light sequence based on real-time traffic conditions.
Pedestrian Safety: Detects pedestrians crossing during a green light and triggers a buzzer to alert vehicles.
Real-Time Sensor Inputs: Uses IR sensors to detect vehicles and pedestrians.
Components Required
1x Arduino Uno (or compatible microcontroller)
4x LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green, Green for side road)
2x IR sensors (to detect vehicles on the main and side roads)
1x Pedestrian sensor (or button to simulate pedestrian detection)
1x Buzzer
Resistors (220Î© for LEDs)
Jumper wires and breadboard
